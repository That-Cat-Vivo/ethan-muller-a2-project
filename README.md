Hello! This is a rather basic program that took me a while to make. 
This was mainly due to me consistantly trying to push how much I can do, until I realized it was both not required, and too much effort.


HERE'S THE CURRENT CONTROLS: 

When you start the program, you will be given a black screen. There, you will be able to draw by clicking with your mouse.

There is a red button in the top left corner of your screen. Push it and you will transfer to the clown screen.
On the clown screen you will see two clowns. Pressing the up and down buttons will increase and decrease the amount of clowns vertically. 
Pressing the left and right buttons will increase the amount of clowns horizontally. 
The clowns will watch your mouse as it moves to different quandrants of the program window. 
If you Right click on the clown screen a clown that stare directly at you will appear at your mouses location.

There is a red button in the top right corner of your screen. 
Push it and you will transfer to the previous screen. (Currently going back to the previous screen will leave any pre-existing clowns flashing in and out of existence.

The yellow button at the bottom left ends the program.
